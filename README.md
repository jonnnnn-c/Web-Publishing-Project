### Company Background:

We are a company started up my 5 NYP students who are every interested in phones. The name of our company is Systematic N Authentic (SNA). The goal of our company is to provide our reviews of the smartphones that we have come across and tried it. All the reviews that we have done are our honest opinions of the smartphones. It all started out as a hobby as we are very interested in what new smartphones has to offer. Those people that have come across our review agreed with our reviews and encouraged us to do more. After 5 years of reviewing all sorts of mobile phones, we were noticed by Samsung and we offered by Samsung marketing team to promote their latest phones. Now, we are working with Samsung marketing team to promote Samsung phones and we are Samsung’s number one promoting company.
